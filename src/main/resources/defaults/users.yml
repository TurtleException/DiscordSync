# This is where user associations are stored.
# The plugin only needs to know the UUID of a Minecraft account and its corresponding Discord user-ID.
# Names will be retrieved by the Discord API when the plugin is loaded or a new player joins.
#
# --- DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
# This may result in false associations, create loops or users might be ignored.
