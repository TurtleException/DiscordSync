# DiscordSync
A simple, easy-to-use spigot plugin that can mirror multiple chats between Discord channels and a Minecraft Server. You
can mirror both guild channels and private channels with either the entire server, a specific world or one or more
select players.

Currently, this plugin is still in development.
There is an [older version](https://github.com/TurtleException/DiscordSync/tree/v02), but it is not publicly available
as a JAR-file and has many known bugs & issues.

As long as the most recent commit isn't older than a few days it is safe to say that the plugin will soon be finished.

### Progress note
As of the end of 2022, almost all planned features are implemented & being tested and debugged. The first beta-releases
should be done early in the new year.
